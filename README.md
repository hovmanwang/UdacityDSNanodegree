# UdacityDSNanodegree
Putting in the coursework for Udacity Data Science Nanodegree

Project Motivation
Open Source has been around for a while and people who contribute to Open Source (a.k.a Open Sourcers) are key to the successful maintenance of the ecosystem of Open Source. This project sets out to investigate the characterstics of Open Sourcers. This is for the first Project under the Advanced Data Scientist Nanodegree - Write a Data Science Blog

Questions intending to answer:

Education: does Higher Education Degrees (B.A. and above) make a person more likely to become an Open Source contributor?

Coding as a Hobby: if you code for fun, are you coding as an Open Source Contributor too?

Coding experience: more years of coding leads to more chances of contributing?

Employment Status: being employed might give you more financial security and peace of mind, but simultaneously less time to be an Open 

Sourcer — so which effect is more predominant?

Salary: does making more money drive more active contribution as an Open Sourcer?

Gender: do men or women like it more?

Python 3.7.6
